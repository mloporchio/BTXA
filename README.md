The paper studies the creation and consumption of _dust_ in the Bitcoin blockchain, i.e., amounts of currency that are smaller than the fees required to spend them in a transaction.

The paper also proposes a new method that allows resource-constrained nodes to retrieve dust transactions by sending authenticated queries to full nodes.
The proposed method employs a variant of the _Merkle R-tree_ authenticated data structure discussed in [2].
